# LeetCode Patterns

Holds my solutions to the [LeetCode Patterns problems](https://seanprashad.com/leetcode-patterns/).

## Task 1 (Contains Duplicate)

Given an integer array nums, return `true` if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return `false` if every element is distinct.

Example:

```text
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: true
```

## Task 2 (Missing Number)

Given an array nums containing `n` distinct numbers in the range `[0, n]`, return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

Example:

```text
Input: nums = [3,0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
```
